# Witness encryption for succinct functional commitments

This library contains a small implementation of witness encryption for succinct functional commitments.

Witness encryption allows you to encrypt a value to whoever has knowledge of a witness. More concretely, in this work, the encryption statement consists of a commitment `cm`, a function `G` and a value `y`; the decryption witness consists of a (non succinct) NIZK proof about the fact that `cm` opens to `v`  such that `y=G(v)`.

The above is made possible through two main building blocks:
1. Smooth Projective Hash Functions
2. Functional Commitments

To see how it can be used, run `cargo test encryption_decryption`.

The SPHF tests use examples from Fabrice Benhamouda's thesis: Diverse modules and zero-knowledge.
